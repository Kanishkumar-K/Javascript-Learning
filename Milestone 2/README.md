## JavaScript Case sensitivity

- Javascript is a case sensitive language.

- This means that language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers are treated differently based on case.

- Example: variables firstname and Firstname are treated differently.

**Camelcase**

- CamelCase is a naming convention in JavaScript where the first letter of a variable, function, or method name is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized. 

``` 
Example: lastName 
```
